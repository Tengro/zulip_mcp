- Closed-channel delivery (#16): mentions and DMs on channels the host has
  not opened arrive as `push/event` with the missed-ambient tally in the
  origin; ambient on closed channels is counted (`channel_missed`).
- Catch-up: persisted per-channel watermarks that advance only on the host's
  acceptance and never past a message the host was offered but did not
  accept (a refusal, a batch lost to a transport failure) — such a message
  is replayed from history once the host answers again, or by the next
  connection's sweep; a `<missed>` block per channel on reconnect (full
  backscroll for channels the host had open, mention ±7 otherwise), paged
  up to `ZULIP_CATCHUP_LIMIT` and hard-capped by
  `ZULIP_MISSED_BLOCK_MAX_CHARS`; a Zulip event-queue expiry is healed from
  history for open and closed channels alike.
- DM conversations are channels (`zulip:dm:<ids>`), discovered from history
  and announced on the fly; `send_dm` by name, email or id (closes #5).
- History on `channels/open` (`limit`, `beforeMessageId`, `sinceLastSeen`),
  `fetch_history` with id cursors (streams, or a DM conversation by channel
  id) and `fetch_around` within the anchor's conversation.
- Filters plane: one hot-reloaded JSON file (stream/DM allowlists, muted
  streams, reaction visibility, operator-owned reaction suppression) with
  `filters_get` / `filters_update` / `mute_channel` / `unmute_channel` /
  `refresh_channels`. The host's reaction-suppression baseline
  (`ZULIP_` or `DISCORD_SUPPRESSED_REACTIONS_BASELINE`; names or glyphs,
  glyphs matched on their codepoints) applies at every start and is never
  persisted.
- Images inlined on live delivery, downsampled to model-max; small text
  attachments inlined (closes #6).
- Live reactions per channel (`set_reaction_visibility`), reactions on
  history lines, `remove_reaction`, `list_emojis`, realm-emoji resolution.
- Rollback checkpoints on every successful `zulip.messaging` tool result
  (`state.checkpoint`), `channels/acknowledge` by reaction, sends split at
  the realm's message length, agent-visible timestamps (`AGENT_TIMEZONE`,
  `AGENT_TIMESTAMP_STYLE`).
